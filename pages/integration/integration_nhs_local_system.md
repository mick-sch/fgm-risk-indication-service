# FGM-IS Local System Integration Requirements #

The [Local System Integration Requirements] document provides NHS funded healthcare providers in England and their NHS IT systems suppliers with a clear description of the interoperability and functional requirements to access the Spine FGM-IS Service from local NHS IT systems to. These requirements supersede those requirements specified in the FGM RIS Local System Integration Information Standard (SCCI2112) for view capability.

# FGM-IS Requirements Specification Guidance #

The [FGM RIS Requirements Specification Guidance] document provides guidance on key messages and wording that should be considered when developing the FGM Information Sharing message within local systems, to provide a level of consistency when referring to the FGM-IS and user display messages.

This document should be read in conjunction with the FGM-IS Local System Integration Requirements Specification.
