## Interoperability Framework Spine Mini Services ##

The common [IF Spine Mini Service Client](images/fgm/IF_Spine_Mini_Service_Common_Client_Requirements_1.0.pdf) and [IF Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP)](images/fgm/IF_Spine_Mini_Service_Common_Provider_requirements_1.0.pdf) requirements have been uplifted to accommodate the FHIR&reg; DSTU2 1.0.2 Standard within the FGM Service. 

## Interoperability Framework FGM-IS Spine Mini Service – Client Requirements ##

The [IF FGM-IS Spine Mini Service – Client Requirements] document is a specification for the implementation of services that are expected to be provided by Spine Mini Service Clients. This document also contains requirements for the design and assurance process. The implementation specification provides some requirements for some non-functional behaviour of the SMS as well as some guidance for implementation decisions.

The requirements in this document will be assured using the Interoperability Framework Accreditation process for Spine Mini Services.

## Interoperability Framework Spine Mini Service – FGM-IS Provider Requirements ##

The [IF FGM-IS Spine Mini Service – Provider Requirements] document is a specification for the implementation of services that are expected to be provided by a Spine Mini Service Provider (SMSP). There are also requirements in here for the design and assurance process. The implementation specification provides some requirements for some non-functional behaviour of the SMSP as well as some guidance for implementation decisions.

Some of the requirements in this document will be assured using the Common Assurance Process and some will be assured using the Interoperability Framework Accreditation process.

## Target Operating Model (TOM) ##

The Target Operating Model (TOM) is used to inform and assist a deploying organisation with the implementation of SMSP integrated systems within their local environment.

It provides an assessment framework of their responsibilities in terms of ensuring that their local systems meets the technical, IG, Clinical safety, and functionality required for the business context.

The TOM is currently presented in a form of a [spreadsheet](images/fgm/TEMPLATE_Target_Operating_Model-Spine_Mini_Service_com_v1.1.xls), with the worksheets broken into the logical assessment sections.

The TOM is typically used in two phases:

- Phase 1 the usage and settings information provided to NHS Digital for approval.
- Phase 2 the actual assessment phase conducted by the supplier and the deploying organisation.
