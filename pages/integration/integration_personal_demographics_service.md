---

## Personal Demographic Service (PDS) ##

FGM clients MUST be capable of performing [Personal Demographic Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics){:target="_blank"} (PDS) tracing of patients to obtain their 'verified' NHS Number.


## Spine Mini Service PDS (SMSP) ##

FGM clients MAY utilise the [Spine Mini Service PDS](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/spine/spine-mini-service-provider-for-personal-demographics-service){:target="_blank"} (SMSP) as a lighter weight alternative to integrating with the full Spine Personal Demographic Service (PDS).


{% include important.html content="As the SMSP service does not return multiple possible matches for the patient it is typically only suitable to be used where there is enough information to achieve a single matched trace." %}
